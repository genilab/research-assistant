- Checks: discovery metadata; minimal Scope, Workflow, and Constraints structure; trigger, responsibility, input, outcome, clarification, and non-goal statements; role, activation, dependencies, and required plan structure.
- Result: PASSED — Actual checks passed.

### Documentation

- Executed: plan, instruction, and source-documentation validation.
- Checks: plan-to-instruction coverage and required code-documentation structure.
- Result: PASSED — Actual checks passed.
