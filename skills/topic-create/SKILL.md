# Create Topic

## Scope

This is an external skill. Use it when the user says `Create topic {topic}` or
`create topic {topic}`. It creates one complete empty research topic, its
topic-level index, and its initial discussion entry. Its input is a
human-readable topic name and optional short description; it produces a slugged
topic folder containing the required records. User activation command:
`Create topic {topic}`.
Primary agent role: knowledge-agent.

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/plan.md` and confirm the topic name is specific enough to become
   a durable knowledge category; ask for clarification if it duplicates an
   existing topic or its intended scope cannot be distinguished.
2. Derive a lowercase hyphenated slug from the confirmed name. Create
   `references/`, `papers/INFO.md`, `experiments/INFO.md`,
   `publications/INFO.md`, `INFO.md`, and the three Knowledge-worker Markdown
   records: `{topic-slug}_info.md`, `{topic-slug}_ideas.md`, and
   `{topic-slug}_refs.md`.
3. Seed the topic INFO from `docs/topic-info-template.md` with a concise
   current-summary placeholder and links to every required record. Seed the
   ideas record with the confirmed topic and an initial discussion or explicitly
   empty prompt. Seed indexes and remaining records with an empty-state note.
4. Add one linked entry to `knowledge/INFO.md`, replacing its empty-state line
   if this is the first topic. The entry must use the display name and the
   folder's relative link.
5. Produce the created folder and initial exploration outcome, and state that
   `Brainstorm about {topic}` can continue the conversation.

## Constraints

- Do not create a topic without the Knowledge-worker core schema, topic INFO,
  research indexes, initial exploration, and main knowledge-info entry.
- Do not put source content in the info record as though it had been learned,
  create a report, or add unrequested topic content; those are non-goals.
- Do not overwrite an existing topic. Escalate a slug collision for a user
  decision rather than silently merging topics.
